# Changelogs of v0.3

## BETA releases

### BETA 1

- Add resource pack extraction. All resource packs inside the `resource_packs` folder of your server will be extracted
  and will together generate a `terrain_textures.json` which contains paths of all blocks to their corresponding
  images. (Custom blocks are also supported)
- Add support for all blocks registered in `GlobalBlockStateHandlers->getSerializer()`, so your custom (`Customies`)
  blocks are supported :D.
- A lot of bug and stability fixes

### BETA 2

- Bug fixes

### BETA 3

- Fix issues with resource packs with different structures. (Almost any folder structure will now work)

- Fix Allowed memory size exhausted issue
- Add `renderer.chunk-loader.queue-size` to the config.yml, this queue contains all regions that are ready to be loaded
  and rendered
