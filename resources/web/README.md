# Web files
This folder contains all files used for the web server.
- In `/pages` you can find all web pages.
- In `/static` you can find all the styles, scripts and libraries used to make the pages functional.

## Can I edit the files?
Yes you can, but it is not recommended. <br>
If the website doesn't work anymore, and you don't know how to fix it, you can remove the `web` folder and restart your server.
