# Settings for the renderer
renderer:
  # Settings for the chunk loader
  # The chunk loader loads all chunks so that they are ready for rendering
  chunk-loader:
    # The amount of chunks the chunk loader can load in a single run
    # Every scheduler.run-period, the chunk-loader will run
    # Setting this number too high will cause the server to lag because of a very long loop
    # A too low number will cause a slower map generation
    # Default: 128
    chunks-per-run: 128

  # Settings for the chunk renderer
  # The chunk renderer manages when a chunk is added to the scheduler
  chunk-renderer:
    # in which interval in ticks the chunk renderer will run
    # Default: 10
    run-period: 10
    # the cooldown in seconds a chunk is not updated when there are updates inside the chunk
    # Default: 60
    chunk-cooldown: 60
    # If the chunk render can use a cache file
    # In this cache file, all chunks that are currently in the queue are stored
    # After a server restart, all regions will be immediately added back to the queue
    # Default: true
    region-cache: true
    # How many chunks there can be yielded from a generator
    # This is used for rendering full worlds, the generator yields all chunks inside the world
    # The best is to yield a bit more than the scheduler can handle simultaneously
    # Default: 10
    generator-yield: 10

  scheduler:
    # in which interval in ticks the chunk renderer will run
    # Default: 5
    run-period: 5
    # the amount of simultaneous renders
    # A render is the image that is generated
    # Default: 5
    renders: 5
    # The queue size of the scheduler
    # Default: 25
    queue-size: 25


# Settings for the web server
# The web server will be accessible at 'http://<address>:<port>/'.
web-server:
  # Address of the web server.
  # Only change this when needed.
  # Default: "127.0.0.1"
  address: "127.0.0.1"
  # Port of the web server.
  # Set this to the port you want to use for the web server
  # Default: 3000
  port: 3000

# Startup settings
# These settings will influence the behaviour of PocketMap when the server starts.
startup:
  # Reload all web files on a server startup.
  # This will reset all the web files back to the original files on each startup.
  # default: false
  reload-web-files: false
